# Dynamical Systems Theory & Fixed Points in Chemical Systems

This application is intended to introduce the application of Dynamical Systems Theory in chemical systems. Through providing a mix of background information and examples, the module will guide the user through defining fixed points in both one and two dimensional chemical systems. This notebook is attached to a complementary notebook linking these concepts to Chemical Organization Theory.
